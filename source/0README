                  Files for OpenMM-Enabled Tinker Executables
                  ###########################################

       The current directory has files to build Tinker-OpenMM versions
       of the ANALYZE, BAR and DYNAMIC programs using the GPU-capable
       OpenMM libraries. The files in this directory should be copied
       into the /source directory of a clean distribution of Tinker, and
       the programs can be compiled and linked in that modified /source
       directory.

       Building the Tinker-OpenMM-enabled executables requires the prior
       installation of OpenMM as downloaded from the Stanford Github site.
       The provided Makefile can then be used, after minor edits to build
       GPU-enabled executables. Either the GNU compilers or the Intel
       compilers can be used. The Makefile assumes OpenMM is found in
       its default location, /usr/local/openmm. NVIDIA CUDA 10 or later
       must be installed on the target machine, as well as a CUDA-capable
       graphics card.
